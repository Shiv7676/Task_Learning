The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser. The window object represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. 

Major differences between a document object and a window object are:-
1.	Window object is the first object loaded in the browser while the document object is loaded inside the window.
2.	Window object is the object of the browser while document object is the object of window property
3.	Properties of a window object cannot be accessed by document object. But on the other hand, properties of a document object can be accessed by window object
4.	Window object consists of all the global objects, functions variables of JS, while document object consists of HTML tags, elements and its attributes
