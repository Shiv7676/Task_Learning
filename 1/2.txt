Objects are a very important data types in JavaScript. Unlike primitive data types, which contain only one type of value, Objects can hold many values in form of 'Key: value pair'. These keys are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.


let resume = {
    Name : "Shivang Agarwal",
    DOB : "26th May",
    Education : "M.Tech",
    Skills : '["JS","Java","C++","Python"]'
}

Here, Name, DOB, Education & Skills are the keys of the object - 'resume' and each key holds its respective values.

The values of the object can be accessed using square brackets, for example resume[Name] will return "Shivang Agarwal". Loops can also be used to iterate through object and access its key:value pairs
